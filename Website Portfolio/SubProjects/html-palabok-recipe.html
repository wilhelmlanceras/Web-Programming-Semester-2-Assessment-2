                <!-- Instructions for preparing the dish -->
                <li>Soak the noodles in water for 30 minutes to soften.</li>
                <li>Boil the noodles for 20 minutes (start timing when water is boiling). Once done, let it stay in the pot for another 15 minutes then drain.</li>
                <li>For the pork, boil it for 1 hour until tender. Add salt to season the pork. Once cooked, cool and chop into small pieces.</li>
                <li>In a separate pan, sauté garlic and onions. Add chopped pork, soy sauce (about 3-4 ladles), black pepper, and Magic Sarap. Cook and mix for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>For the tinapa, remove the bones, shred it and toast in a dry pan until lightly brown.</li>
                <li>For the sauce, use the broth from the pork. Add Knorr chicken cubes, Magic Sarap, soy sauce, and atsuete for coloring. Mix in flour and cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the sauce.</li>
                <li>Assemble the Palabok by placing the noodles on a plate, pouring the sauce on top, and adding the pork mixture, tinapa, boiled eggs, chicharon, spring onions, and calamansi on the side.</li>
